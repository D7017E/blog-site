The thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. I really appreciate how optimistic, joyful, and funny Terry Pratchett's books are.
For me they are the ultimate 'comfort food' books, easy to read and easy to enjoy.

## Slaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut
#### publ. 1969, read 2022-05
<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10%; width: 15vw; height: 50vh;" src="/img/books/SL5.jpg" />

An antiwar book about the bombing of Dresden, where almost twenty-five thousand people were killed. Kurt Vonnegut, the author, was present for the bombing.
The book is partly him coming to terms with the war. The book follows Billy Pilgrim, an American soldier in the second world war. It is told by an unreliable narrator,
in a non-linear order. 

The story features a lot of science-fiction elements. At first I was thrown off by this, thinking that this book was to be a more 'realistic' depiction of the war.
After having read it I think that the science-fiction elements serve to underline the cruelty of the war.
