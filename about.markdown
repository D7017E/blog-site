We are a group of 12 students from the Luleå University of Technology.
In our fifth year we are now taking a course, D7017E, where we are
working together with a company to develop some software.

Together with [Luleå Makerspace](https://www.luleamakerspace.se/) we are
working on developing functionality for a robot, 
[Pepper](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/pepper). 
Luleå Makerspace is an ideal organization' work is mainly introducing children
to programming and modern technology. The organization focuses on gender equality,
and has as a goal to make girls and young women more welcome in the tech-space.
Part of the project is aiming to make programming on the robot accessible to 
everyone with the help of a block programming language. Another part is focused
on developing custom interactions for the robot, such as playing hide and seek, or
telling an interactive story.

## Group members
### Block programming
Our goal is to create a block programming solution for kids to be able to program the Pepper robot in an easy way.
We believe kids can build an interest with new technology by seeing first-hand hanges from code to movement of the Pepper robot.
