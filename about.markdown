We are a group of 12 students from the Lule√• University of Technology.
In our fifth year we are now taking a course, D7017E, where we are
working together with a company to develop some software.

Together with [Grepit AB](https://www.grepit.se/) we are developing
a smart home system. This smart home system will consist of a
mobile application, a backend, and a robotic arm that will
automatically insert a charging cable into an electric vehicle.
