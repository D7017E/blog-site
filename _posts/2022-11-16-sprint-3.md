## Block programming
Block programming has worked together to make sure that The block server and the blockly site can 
communicate together. We have also made sure that two of the groups' computers can be used to host
the block programming. This was done in preparation for the open house we will be hosting together
with Lule√• Makerspace on the 19:th.

### Block server
Aside from syncing with the blockly group, we have mostly done some small house cleaning during this 
sprint. We have started using Pylint, the common linter we decided to use. We have also started work
on a docker file, which should allow us to more easily host the program when we are done. 

A composite function, in the form of a dance, has been started. This function, when called via a block,
should make Pepper dance. We are thinking that it will probably start music as well. After some other 
composite functions, the only thing we have left to implement is a "joystick" mode, where Pepper can be
controlled with, for example, the WASD buttons. This was requested by Peter Parnes, as a way to more 
easily control Pepper.
