The 19:th of november we had an open house at Lule책 University of Technology together with 
Lule책 Makerspace. This open house is an opportunity for the development team to get some
feedback on what our intended audience (mostly younger children) like and dislike. It is,
of course, also an opportunity for Lule책 Makerspace to host a fun event for people interested
in modern technology.
