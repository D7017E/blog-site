The 19:th of november we had an open house at Lule책 University of Technology together with 
Lule책 Makerspace. This open house is an opportunity for the development team to get some
feedback on what our intended audience (mostly younger children) like and dislike. It is,
of course, also an opportunity for Lule책 Makerspace to host a fun event for people interested
in modern technology.

We began our open house with a short introduction to our work, and what we wanted to show.
Afterward, we showed the web interaction. We took requests from the audience and searched
Google and Wikipedia for information about their requests. 

After web interaction we showed rock paper scissors. Audience members lined up to play rock
paper scissors with Pepper. The detection of hands was somewhat rocky to start with, but became
better as time went on.

Finally we let the audience try to program Pepper with the help of block programming. This
section was probably the longest in duration. In the middle of this section we all took a 
break and had warm chocolate from SRT fika room.

The open house was a success, and we got a lot of valuable feedback from a lot of people.
Block programming and rock paper scissors was very appreciated among the children.
In block programming, dancing and talking seemed to be the blocks most used.
