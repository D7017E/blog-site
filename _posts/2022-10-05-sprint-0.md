## Block programming

Block programming has been divided into two parts. One part is responsible for building a Blockly site, and generating the Python2.7 code from blocks. Another part will develop an application that receives Python2.7 code from the Blockly site, and interprets and evaluates that code. This latter part will have the Pepper SDK to be able to communicate with Pepper. 

So far, the Blockly group has looked at the test repository for Blockly, and tried some different blocks. There has been some issues generating Python2.7 code, which will need to be looked at in the coming sprint.

The Pepper communication group has set up an UML schema for the application. They have also started working on Pepper behavior, such as text-to-speech, changing the leds in the eyes, rotating the head, e.t.c.
