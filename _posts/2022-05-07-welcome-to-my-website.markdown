Hey! This is my first post for my new website. This website is built using Jekyll, and hosted using GitHub Pages. 
I have some experience with React, and building websites with it, but wanted something more light weight. Jekyll
works well for that.

At the time of writing I am close to finishing my fourth year of computer science at Luleå University of Technology.
I am currently taking two courses, one about declarative languages, and the other an in-depth course in pervasive computing.

In pervasive computing I am developing further on a project I was a part of earlier. The goal is to use a drone with an
ultrasonic sensor to map a room. I might share some more about it later!

I think the declarative langagues course is very interesting. It is a very different way of thinking, as compared to
imperative programming. We have used two languages, first Haskell and then Prolog. Haskell is a functional language,
and Prolog is a logic language. 

One exercise in Prolog was quite interesting. Since Prolog is basically a language where you query a database of
logical truths, it is well suited for something called state space search ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search)).
The exercise consisted of guiding a robot through a series of rooms, where entering the room had some requirement from the robot.
If you are interested in the code for this project, you can find it at [github](https://github.com/HugPet/D7012E-P1).

I think this will do for now.

Talk to you later! \\(^_^)/

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
