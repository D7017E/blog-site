On the 13th of may, I travelled to Stockholm to take part in the Netlight Experience. Netlight experience
is a day for Netlight to give fourth-year students a chance to see what working at Netlight is like. 

I travelled there with a friend and fellow student. My impressions are quite positive, and the experience
really sparked an interest in further researching Netlight.
