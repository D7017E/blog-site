We choose as a group that we would work less in this sprint due to the exam period that expanded almost 2 weeks, therefore we haven't been able to do that much this sprint as we would have liked.

## Block programming
### Block server
In this sprint we have implemented a way to retrieve code from the blockly server with the help of HTTP calls and a library called Flask. We don't have any security for this code that comes from the HTTP call. This will be discussed if we need to have it. The server can retrieve code and then add this to a queue. We can then run each program by calling extract from the queue. As of right now we don't have any time limit for a program. Meaning that if the input is a while loop that will run forever, then the program will run forever. We plan on having some time limit for a program. We don't know currently how long this time limit should be or if it should be dynamically changed based on how large the input program is.
