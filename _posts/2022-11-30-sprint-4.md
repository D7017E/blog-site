## Block programming


### Block server


### Blockly
The open house with Lule√• Makerspace gave us a lot of work, mainly with showing more information to the children about the queue and their programs status on the server. This was becase most children don't have the patience tow ait for their program to run when they don't have an estimated time to wait or a known place in the queue(which updates when a program is executed). The children also wanted to be able to edit their program once queued so they don't need to requeue another program id they make a small change.

Another feature currently in progress is a small admin interface where LMS employees can modify the queue by deleting programs, clearing the queue and pause/resume the execution of programs.

The final main feedback was that the children wanted to bea ble to do maths and use variables when programming Pepper, this feature was already in development but was not stable enough befoer the 19th of Novemeber but now it is done by utilizing shadowblocks.

Lastly, the site is now available in both Swedish and English as mentioned as a request in previous sprints. This took longer than wanted to fix because Blockly could not change language once it has rendered for some obscure reason and therefore an alternative solution was a *pre-editor* page or *homepage* where the user can choose language. This page also introduced the basic/advanced mode choice, the basic mode can fully program Pepper but without variables, functions and some other syntaxes in order to be more friendly and inviting for beginners.
