During the academic year of 2020-2021 I was the lead for the Google Developer Student Club at Luleå University of Technology.
Google Developer Student Clubs are community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies. 
During my time as lead, I organized for our club to be speakers at an international meeting for various Google groups. 
The club developed a pedagogical game for nursing students at Luleå University of Technology. 

It was very rewarding to lead the club, and I am grateful for having had the opportunity.
